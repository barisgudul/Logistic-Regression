# 🚀 Logistic Regression Analysis Project

## 🌟 Overview

This project explores how logistic regression can be used to solve classification problems. By preparing data, building a model, and evaluating its performance, it demonstrates a practical approach to making predictions with real-world data.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of three columns:

| **Column**          | **Description**                                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Age`               | The age of the individual.                           |
| `EstimatedSalary`   | The individual's estimated annual salary.            |
| `Purchased`         | Binary target variable (1 for purchase, 0 for no purchase). |

### Example Rows from the Dataset:

| **Age** | **EstimatedSalary** | **Purchased** |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|
| 19      | 19000               | 0             |
| 35      | 20000               | 0             |
| 26      | 43000               | 0             |
| 27      | 57000               | 0             |
| 19      | 76000               | 0             |
| 27      | 58000               | 0             |
| 27      | 84000               | 0             |
| 32      | 150000              | 1             |

This dataset provides the foundation for applying logistic regression to predict purchase decisions based on age and estimated salary.
